# Capstone-Project
# Title : MAXIMIZING CUSTOMER RETENTION BY PREDICTING CUSTOMER CHURN 

# Description : 
Given the details on customers’ orders and promotion emails sent, the task is to predict whether the 
customer is churned or retained. Also, we study the effect of email promotion on the customer churn rate, so that we 
can explain whether upsell or cross-selling of products improves the customer relationship

# Suggestions:
In order to retain the customers, the retailers adapted various marketing strategies and market basket analysis and
various other methods to study their customer shopping pattern. As per our literature survey, we have seen that the
customer churn was predicted mainly based on CRM records, feedbacks from social media, feedback survey conducted
on behalf of the company. But our perspective is that most of the marketing is done through primary mode of
communication which is email. So, in this project, we are going to analyze whether the promotional emails sent to the
customer has any effect on customer churn.
Based on the analysis, we suggest that, offers and freebies can be offered for customer who will be churned. More
customised offers can be given to them. Further if we get the data on products that they have purchased, we can
perform market basket analysis and provide them better recommendations by Identifying the patterns of shopping in
the customers
